# dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! Dotfiles manage my system-wide development settings. When you spend most of your day in the terminal, it makes sense to make it fast, efficient, and useful. If you're interested in seeing other configuration options or just seeing more examples of dotfiles, there's a wonderful GitHub Pages site with a [collection of examples](https://dotfiles.github.io).

Dotfiles are often stored in the $HOME directory under various sub-folders. To avoid extra tooling or symlinks to track these files, I use an elegant technique posted by StreakyCobra on Hacker News.
If you're want to explore how it works, you can read about the system [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) - it uses a Git bare repository and aliases in a nifty way.
